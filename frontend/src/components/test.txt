I want to enhance the manager roster design, 
1) remove the chips from name or other keep chiips only for number or boolean like yes or no or status. it must be readable without any effort
2) sort the manager roster view by recommended_product column which shows the values first and then null values for column
3) for recommendation view, I like the table  but it too much horizontal scrollong can we keep some columns in table and other hidden and button to show all metrics it views all the metrics?
